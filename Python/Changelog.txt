Version 1
-Global Variables adjusted at top to alter RISK LEVEL filter and 
 Saccade Filtering 


Version .998
-New Area Under the Curve Calculation uses rectangle approximations instead of straight line sums. the width of each rectangle is measured by an approximation of (saccade length)/(#saccade values). 
-Confidence ratings added to have a check for a likelihood of error in STAS calculation
- RISK Level added: Risk level settings must be adjusted for each data set and are only used as a guide
-Weighting included to bias the saccade direction calculation towards the first half of
saccade direction
- 


Version .997
-fixed carry-over problem when a trial ends with 1's and new subjects begins with 1's EdgeCase#1
-If saccade goes backwards the saccadeLength will be set to negative and eventually discarded


Version .996
- Fixed end point assignment for L2R and R2l 
- pixel to degrees conversion (self.screenAngle) changed from 42 to 38,
in all versions


Version 0.995 

- Fixed the calculation of end point assignment
  for T2B and B2t
  previous assignment was changing the actual endpoint
  this version will now properly discard extraneous data
  points in saccade but retain the proper end point
