Demonstrations, Samples, and Examples of Working Code

The B2T Code is one program among a suite of tools 
used for accurate calculations of Saccade trajectory Deviations. 
Originally developed for data analysis of Explicit and Implicit Attention studies 
at the Cognitive Psychology Research Lab of Albrecht Inhoff at SUNY Binghamton.  
The saccade deviations are calculated from obtaining the maximum deviation point 
from the top of the saccadic arc to a theoretical line spanning from the beginning to the
end of the saccade. The datasets were obtained from experiments on subjects using an EyeLink 1000.These outputs
,.csv files, should be split apart column-wise, to set the inputs for the B2T. Due to the common
problem of noise in the data from recording a biological system, the program has a set of parameters
for removing bad data. There are also output flags for determining high to low risk error rates in
the filtering.
